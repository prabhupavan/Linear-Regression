# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered.Decision trees can be used for classification as well as regression problems. The name itself suggests that it uses a flowchart like a tree structure to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits.
Decision trees imitate human thinking, so itâ€™s generally easy for data scientists to understand and interpret the results. It starts with a root node and ends with a decision made by leaves.

### Root Nodes : 
It is the node present at the beginning of a decision tree from this node the population starts dividing according to various features.

### Decision Nodes :
The nodes we get after splitting the root nodes are called Decision Node

### Leaf Nodes :
The nodes where further splitting is not possible are called leaf nodes or terminal nodes

### Sub-tree :
Just like a small portion of a graph is called sub-graph similarly a sub-section of this decision tree is called sub-tree.

### Pruning : 
It is nothing but cutting down some nodes to stop overfitting.
