# Support Vector Machine

SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

The main concept of SVM is to plot each 
data item as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value 
of a particular coordinate. Here n would be the features we would have.

At first approximation what SVMs do is to find a separating line(or hyperplane) between data of two classes. SVM is an algorithm that takes the data as an input and outputs a line that separates those classes if possible.
