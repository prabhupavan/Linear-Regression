# Linear-Regression

In machine learning, linear regression is one of the simplest algorithms that you 
can apply to a dataset to model the relationships between features and labels.

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.
θ1: intercept
θ2: coefficient of x
